            You can help too! Here are some things you can do to help: 
            <ol>
            <li>Put fertilizer at a appropriate time, don't put your fertilizer before it will rain, otherwise the fertilizer will runoff.</li>
            <li>If you're getting new grass or plants, try to get ones that need less fertilizer. Try to get natural fertilizers as well, such as dung and compost.</li>
            <li>Spread the word! Tell your friends and family about the problem!</li>
            <li>Try to get fertilizer that contains a safe or less amount of nitrogen and/or phosphorous.</li>
            <li>When applying fertilizer, mix it well! Make sure it is nicely underground.</li>
            </ol>
