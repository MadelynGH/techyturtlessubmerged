            You can help too! Here are some things you can do to help: 
            <ol>
            <li>Try not to put fertilizer in right before it rains to reduce runoff.</li>
            <li>If you're getting new grass or plants, try to get some that need less fertilizer. Try to use natural fertilizers as well, such as dung or compost.</li>
            <li>Spread the word! Tell your friends and family about the problem!</li>
            <li>Try to get fertilizer that contains a safe amount of nitrogen and/or phosphorous.</li>
            <li>When applying fertilizer, mix it well! Make sure it's nicely underground.</li>
            </ol>
