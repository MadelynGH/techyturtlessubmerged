                Hello! We are Techy Turtles #66569, a First Lego League Challenge team of 6.
                <br>
                Our team consists of:
                <ul>
                    <li>Aarna (5th grade)</li>
                    <li>Abby (6th grade)</li>
                    <li>Katerina (8th grade)</li>
                    <li>Madelyn (6th grade)</li>
                    <li>Raahi (6th grade)</li>
                    <li>Shriya (6th grade)</li>
                    <li>Coach Shalini</li>
                    <li>Coach Chintan</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We are based in Cary, NC. Our team got together in early-mid August.
                <br>
                Shriya, Aarna, and Madelyn were on a team together last year.
                Abby and Katerina were on a different team together last year.
                Raahi was on her school team last year, but they didn't go to competition.
                <br><br>
                Our innovation project is on dead zones, or hypoxic areas in the ocean.
                <br><br>
                We have two robots. Their names are Mahi Mahi and Object Oriented Olive Ridley Sea Turtle (Ridley).
                <br>
                The names are based off of some of the team names in consideration that didn't make the cut.
