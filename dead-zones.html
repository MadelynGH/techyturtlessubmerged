            <h1>Dead Zones</h1>
            <p>Dead zones are areas in the ocean where there is little or no oxygen.
            <br><br>
            Dead zones are caused by nutrient runoff from things such as lawn fertilizers that contain excess nutrients, primarily nitrogen and phosphorus.
            <br>
            When the nutrients enter coastal waters, they help fertilize blooms of algae.
            When the algae get decomposed by bacteria, the process consumes dissolved oxygen from surrounding waters.
            <br><br>
            Very low oxygen levels can kill most species of fish,
            resulting in the decline of ecologically important fish,
            and disrupting marine food webs.
            <br>
            Meanwhile, without predators, the few aquatic animals who can tolerate low-oxygen
            conditions— like jellyfish and some squid—can become overabundant, as can bacteria.
            <br>
            The harmful algal blooms that cause dead zones can make water dangerous for swimming and pollute
            coastal air, impacting tourism in those areas. The blooms can also release unpleasant odors, and cause fish kills
            that can wash hundreds of dead fish onto beaches.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Scientists have identified 415 dead zones worldwide. Hypoxic areas have increased dramatically during the past 50 years, from about 10 documented cases in 1960 to at least 169 in 2007. The majority of the world’s dead zones are located along the eastern coast of the United States, and the coastlines of the Baltic States, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.</li>
                <li>The largest dead zone in the world lies in the Arabian Sea, covering almost the entire 63,700-square mile Gulf of Oman.</li>
                <li>Dead zones account for about 1% of the world’s total ocean area.</li>
